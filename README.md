# Markdown Slides

Create and Preview markdown presentations in the [marp-format](https://marpit.marp.app/?id=how-to-use).

You can export an HTML-Version of your presentation by running the "Open in Browser" action when previewing a file. Use the browser's print dialog to generate a PDF.

## Configuration

The directory for slides is at `~/slides` by default, but it can be changed in the extension settings.

Pages are separated by horizontal ruler (`---`) to enable compatibility with Marp by default, but it is possible set it to multiple newline characters instead.

## Themes 

Available [themes](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/blob/main/themes/README.md):
- default
- gaia
- uncover
